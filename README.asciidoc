The `io.aviso/tracker` library is used to track operations per-thread; it compliments the stack trace by identifying the reasons
for the function calls`, not just the fact that they occur.

Tracker builds on `org.clojure/tools.logging` to log tbe operation stack when an exception occurs, 
and uses `io.aviso/pretty` to format the exception it logs.
